# Dotfiles using YADM

Very much a WIP, #goalz is to finally get my linux and mac machines... somewhat synced up. Probably I will learn a lot and break a good bit in the process of 'cleaning' up my configuration.

- FYI, digging this tool so far: [YADM](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm)

  - Blog post about the it, TLDR: pretty simple layer over git.

## Instructions

```{bash}
git clone <>

ln -s ~/Dropbox/.aws ~/.aws
ln -s ~/Dropbox/.zsh_secrets ~/.zsh_secrets # temporary - this should get moved to a plugin
ln -s ~/Dropbox/.ssh ~/.ssh

```

```{bash}

```


## Todo List

- [history-sync](https://github.com/wulfgarpro/history-sync) in a safe, secure way!
- Bootstrap script + optional install app groupings + linux/osx
- Write up a post like [this one!](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/04/17/dotfiles-document-and-automate-your-macbook-setup/)
- Sync OSX Settings + Other inspiration
